<h2>Why is this course useful?</h2>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<p>The study of materials allows engineers to select the right material properties for any designed part.</p>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<h2>Where do we use material science?</h2>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<p>Material Science is used any time a part goes from design into prototyping. We use it to find the right material for the part. Material science is used in every area of engineering.</p>

<h2>What will I learn?</h2>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<p>Material science is broken into five families of materials:</p>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<ol>
	<li>Metals: Metallurgy and grain anaylsis.</li>
	<li>Cermaics and glasses: Concrete, and newer metal ceramics.</li>
	<li>Polymers: Plastics (Thermoplastic, Thermoset),Elastomers, Adhesives and more! </li>
	<li>Composites: Mixtures between two different families and materials.</li>
	<li>Nanomaterials: Small structures in materials that include many new developments in material science.</li>
</ol>
