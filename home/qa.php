<h3>What is different between this website and Wikipedia?</h3>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<p>First of all, Wiki although great for getting good information quickly, often creates lots of confusion with their academic language. I strive for more simplistic language. I write in a different style that is more personal than Wiki and all the other information websites out there.</p>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<h3>What kind of content can I expect?</h3>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<p>More speech style language and videos that use memes, jokes, and applets to make engineering fun, engaging, and easy to learn.</p>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<h3>Great, how do I use this website?</h3>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<p>Click that little blue button with plus sign in the top left corner. That should show you a menu of pages in the the current section. Want to switch the section? Click on any of the buttons with icons at the top of the page.</p>
