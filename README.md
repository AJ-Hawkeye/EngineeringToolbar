#Welcome to the Engineering Toolbar Website Repository

##What is this.
Funny you ask, currently these are my mechanical engineering notes. But eventually they will be everyone's. I am making a engineering hub. 

##Who can help?
Do you know how to code? Do you want to do some website development? Do you know something about Engineering? Do you want to share your knowledge? Are you a human?
If you answered yes to any of those questions, you can join this club. 
The only test I have for you right now is to find the link to the join our team form hidden somewhere in the code. Find it and answer the question and we will get back to you.

##How can I use this website.
Clone this directory to a htdoc or html folder on your computer and run a php server and you will have your very own local Engineering Toolbar website.
(if you don't know what that means just look up either Xampp or an equivalent)

##Documentation
With code come resposibilty to explain the code to us apes. 

If you want to know more about the content, there is a trello page dedicated to the current content progress.

If you want to know more about the development progress there is a projects tab that has all the current projects.

The wiki tab has information to make your own pages. (Format, Style, Content)

Happy trails kid!!
